# My-Responsive-Portfolio---Suhani-Narayankar
My Responsive Portfolio with all my details about education, academic background and extra-curricular activities.
This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, achievements, and experience as a Computer Science Engineering student and passionate developer. It highlights my journey, technical expertise, and leadership roles, along with my work on various projects like HOLOCall â€” Hologram Video Calling, Built-in Billing Trolley (SIH-2024), and more.

The website is fully responsive, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes smooth animations, an interactive navigation bar, and a contact form integrated with Formspree. It serves as a single platform to explore my profile, technical strengths, certifications, and professional accomplishments.
